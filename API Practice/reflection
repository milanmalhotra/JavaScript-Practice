This project went much smoother than I was expecting. When I first started thinking about how do go about doing this project, I was lost on the steps needed to be taken. After going over lecture videos on APIs as well as looking over the weather app code, I was able to get a more clear understanding of how to setup the project. The most difficult part was definitely accessing the correct data/getting to that data. Once you were able to get the correct data, displaying them to the page was a piece of cake. Next to getting the correct data, the second hardest part was getting the ingredients/measures. Because they did not store the data in a single array for each (one array for ingredients, one for measures) I had to loop through all the data points and select the ones that were equal to strIngredient[#] and strMeasure[#]. Thankfully, the ingredient number matched up with the measure so I just added them both to separate arrays and took the index position of each and combined them. The steps I took for this project were as follows: step 1, get the food data from the api. Step 2, look through data and pull out the needed data. Step 3, display that data to the webpage. Step 4, work on random button and do the same as step 2. After all info is correctly displayed to the page, I worked on styling. Overall, this project was super fun because I had never worked with APIs before and it proved to be a good challenge for me.
